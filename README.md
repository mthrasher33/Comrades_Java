# Comrades! The First International Dating Site for Communists
(written in Java)


Comrades! is a Java application that simulates an online dating site for communists. Users create accounts with a user name, their age, and a list of hobbies.
Hobbies are used to match users with famous communist thinkers. Matches between the user and other communists are deemed "Strong, Moderate, or Weak" comrades depending on how closely the user's hobbies align with other users on the site.
Communist profiles are pulled from Wikipedia using JSoup, a Java web scraping utility, and users can interact with their comrades by viewing an individual profile and chatting.
The chat feature allows user to enter whatever message they want. Communists respond to chats with a sentence pulled from their Wikipedia page. 
The project deploys an MVC architecture, web scraping, polymorphism, enums, and Java Swing.
